# Blockchain Programming

Welcome to my repository dedicated to the **Blockchain Programming** course. Here, you will find all the assignments and projects I completed as part of this course.

## Repository Content

### ERC20-TD: Development of an ERC20 Token

This assignment focused on creating and interacting with a custom ERC20 token. Below is an overview of the tasks accomplished:

- **ERC20 Token Implementation**: Developed a custom ERC20 token contract with a dynamically assigned ticker and initial supply.
- **Token Deployment**: Deployed the token to the Holesky test network and registered it with an evaluator smart contract.
- **Token Distribution**: Implemented functions to distribute tokens (`getToken`) and enable users to purchase tokens with ETH (`buyToken`).
- **Access Control**: Added an allow list with multi-tiered rules to restrict access to the `getToken` and `buyToken` functionalities.
- **Workshop Integration**: Created a single function to execute all exercises in one transaction, completing the workshop requirements.
